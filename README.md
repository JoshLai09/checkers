# Checkers
A simple checkers variant made using Python

## How to play:
Pieces can move in any direction, and jump over enemy pieces to capture them

White and Black both select a piece to be removed from the board, and the game starts with White making the first move.

To select the piece you want to move, enter the algebraic coordinate in the format of (row)(col), e.g., A1. Then, enter the coordinates of the square you want to move to.

The player who captures all their opponent's pieces is the winner. A draw happens when both players only have one piece left, or if no captures have been made for 20 moves.
